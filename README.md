# Dorothys-Dowel-PIns

I am almost done with Dorothys Dowel pins. I am on the last assignment. 

# Description

The point of this assignment was to learn configurations. I built these pins with things to change the dimensions. The pins are going to be used to attach to objects. 

# Reflection

This assignment wasn't that hard to be honest, it was also shorter. I liked learning that I can adjust the size of the pins, its something I can and will use in the future.
